Thanks for generating and downloading Skyhawk's Relations Game!

Important information:
The app.js file is the backend server which controls most game functions. All other
files are intended for use from the client perspective (index.html).

Included with this game in the cardFiles directory are example csv files that contain card
information. For the Relations game, rows are sets of related cards. Each row must have at least
two cells of card information. Do not change the name of any files in the cardFiles directory.
Contents may be changed so long as they follow the above rules.

Note: Above instructions can omit the Create Node.js Application, since the application
itself was auto generated by MOLEGA's editor (i.e., the code contained in this file).

This set of game files uses Node.js version 12.18.2
package.json is a file that contains all dependency packages required to run this
game. Use npm install before launching the node app to ensure that everything runs as intended.
